;) Copied in the rmarkdown cheat sheet for handy reference into the manuscript folder. When I get stuck I turn to the [Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). 

I was today years old when I learnt about the [`rticlles::`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package. 

It has several templates built in in which we can write code and use what seems to be a quasi form of tex, which is handy because I know my way around tex pretty well. It may well have a template that's appropropriate for our submission. 

In the meantime, I have ported the manuscript to a [Tufte](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-handouts.html) html document, that puports to produce a similar pdf, which might be nice for preprint. 

To see what formats are supported,

```{r}
# install 
install.packages("rticles")

# then run
getNamespaceExports("rticles")
```

Or just take a scroll of the [readme](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles).
