```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(kableExtra)

```

<!-- <aside> -->
<!-- ```{r codefolder, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- codefolder::distill(init = "show") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Load packages.


```{r pkg, message=FALSE}
# packages used in this walkthrough
library(tidyverse) 

# the tidyverse is a metapackage that loads a suite of tools
# useful for working with and summarising data

```


<aside>
If you don't already have the packages installed, run `install.packages("package name here")` in the console pane to install on your system.

Let's get some data to work with.


```{r}

# import data
example_dat <- 
  read_csv("data-raw/Haddawayetal2018bufferstrips.csv")

```

Before we try opening the dataset, let's take a look at its dimensions.

```{r}
example_dat %>% 
  dim() %>% # get dimensions
  { # formatting
    tibble(
      rows = .[1],
      columns = .[2]
    )
  } %>% 
  kable()

```

Not so large it can't be viewed in RStudio. Run the following to inspect the data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(example_dat)
```
